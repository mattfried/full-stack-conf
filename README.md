Full Stack Conference bootstrap project website

### About:
Full Stack Conference is a single page mock website that serves as the info and registration hub for an upcoming conference.

### Approach:
This website was developed using Bootstrap as the main framework to get familiar with using this popular open source toolkit. A pop-up registration form with form field validation is incorporated to imitate a real life situation where a form needs to be completed prior to being submitted to a back end server. The schedule section is adaptive, as in the current agenda item will be highlighted based on the current time zone.

The design elements and general format of this page were provided in an online web development course.
